# Dataset Information
This dataset consists of runtime information from running MiniGraph on Twitter. 
It consists of tuples <type, current_niter, total_niters, sum_indegree, sum_outdegree, num_avtive_vertexes, sum_visited_border_vertexes_in, sum_visited_border_vertex_out, elapsed_time>.
Among these, 'type' denotes the where the information collected from (type = 0 means this tuple is from avtive vertexes-level, type = 1 denotes that the tuple is from fragement-level).
